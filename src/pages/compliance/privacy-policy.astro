            performance of a contract to which you are a party; (iii) compliance with a legal obligation;

            and (vi) Haul's legitimate interests, provided such interests are not overridden by your fundamental
            rights and freedoms. Personal Information may be Processed for the following purposes:
            <br />
            (a) to provide, schedule, and manage Services;
            <br />
            (b) to generate quotes and facilitate bookings, including through AI Processing;
            <br />
            (c) to verify the compliance and qualification of sub-haulers and carriers;
            <br />
            (d) to process payments and prevent fraud;
            <br />

            (h) to maintain safety, security, and integrity of the Services, systems, and assets.
            <br />
            Where we rely on legitimate interests, they include securing and improving the Services, preventing
            fraud and abuse, and ensuring network and information security. In some cases, providing certain
            Personal Information is a legal or contractual requirement; if you choose not to provide such
            information, we may be unable to provide some or all of the Services to you. Where required
            by law, we obtain your opt-in consent before processing Sensitive Personal Information (for
            example, precise geolocation).

            All such disclosures are made pursuant to written agreements requiring the recipient to
            maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information, implement appropriate security
            measures, and use the information solely for the purposes specified by Haul. Where
            required by law, Haul will enter into data processing agreements with Service Providers
            that include instructions for processing, confidentiality obligations, and security
            requirements. We have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information to
            service providers and contractors for business purposes: identifiers; commercial
            information; internet or electronic activity; geolocation data (if enabled);

            Information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. Haul does not "share" Personal Information for cross-context
            behavioral advertising without your consent where such consent is required by law. You may
            exercise applicable "Do Not Sell or Share" rights via the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal

            1) <strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to direct Haul not to "sell" or "share"
            your Personal Information. "Sell" means disclosing Personal Information to a third party for
            monetary or other valuable consideration. "Share" means disclosing Personal Information to
            a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, regardless of monetary consideration.
            <br />
            2) <strong>How to Exercise.</strong> You may exercise your "Do Not Sell or Share" rights at
            any time by: (i) emailing privacy@subhaul.com with the subject "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal
            Information."

            3) <strong>Global Privacy Control.</strong> If you enable a legally recognized browser-based
            opt-out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control), Haul will treat that signal as
            a valid request to opt-out of sale or sharing for the browser or device in use.
            <br />
            4) <strong>Authorized Agents.</strong> You may designate an authorized agent to submit an
            opt-out request on your behalf. We will require proof of the agent's authority and may ask
            you to verify your identity directly.
            <br />
            5) <strong>Scope of Opt-Out.</strong> When you opt out, Haul will stop selling or sharing
            your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. This opt-out does not
            restrict our ability to disclose Personal Information to service providers or contractors
            for business purposes, as permitted by law.
            <br />
