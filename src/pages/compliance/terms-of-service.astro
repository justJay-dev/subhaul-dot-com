      <strong>HAULING AUTHORITY LLC - CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This Customer Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement" or "Terms of Service") is entered into
      by and between Hauling Authority, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Haul, Co., a Utah
      corporation, with its principal place of business at 1575 South River Road, St. George, Utah
      84790 (hereinafter referred to as the "Carrier of Record"), and the undersigned customer
      (the "Customer" or "you").
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You may interact with Haul, Co.'s website and technology platform (the "Haul Platform") to
      receive pricing estimates and manage your booking. However, when you confirm a move, you are
      entering into a transportation contract with Hauling Authority LLC as the federally licensed
      motor carrier of record. Customer payments are made to Hauling Authority LLC, and Hauling
      Authority LLC is responsible for performing or arranging the transportation services under
      its FMCSA authority.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU MAY WAIVE CERTAIN
        RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE
        EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. CERTAIN CLAIMS MAY STILL BE PURSUED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR
        THROUGH REGULATORY AGENCIES.

    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>1. SCOPE OF SERVICES</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        1.1 <em>Authority.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Carrier of Record provides interstate and intrastate household goods transportation under
      authority granted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        1.2 <em>Service Types.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Services are performed by Hauling Authority LLC as motor carrier (USDOT No. 4435598, MC No.
      1745912), and provides all moves under its own authority as the federally licensed motor
      carrier of record. In some cases, Carrier of Record may engage qualified third-party motor
      carriers or independent contractors ("Sub-Haulers") to assist with services. These
      Sub-Haulers operate under Carrier of Record's direction and authority. Regardless of whether
      Carrier of Record performs the services with its own personnel or through Sub-Haulers,
      Carrier of Record remains fully responsible as the carrier of record for the transportation
      of your goods and for any claims for loss or damage, as provided under federal law,
      including the Carmack Amendment (49 U.S.C. § 14706) and 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        1.3 <em>Federal Preemption*</em>
      </strong>
      .* Services are governed by federal law, including the Carmack Amendment (49 U.S.C. § 14706)
      and 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c), which preempts certain state laws relating to rates, routes, and
      services.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>2. QUOTES, ESTIMATES, AND FINAL CHARGES</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        2.1 <em>Binding Estimates; Survey; Revisions.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Unless otherwise stated in writing, quotes are binding estimates based on the inventory and
      access information provided by Customer and may be supported by a physical or virtual
      survey. Binding estimates apply only to the declared scope. If the scope changes before
      loading, Carrier of Record will either reaffirm the binding estimate or issue a revised
      binding estimate for Customer's signature prior to loading, consistent with 49 CFR §
      375.403.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        2.2 <em>Final Charges.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Final charges are determined in accordance with Carrier of Record's published tariff,
      maintained under 49 U.S.C. § 13702 and FMCSA regulations, available for inspection upon
      request. Final charges will not exceed the binding estimate except for additional services
      authorized by the Customer. Charges are based on actual weight, volume, time, distance, and
      services rendered. Customer acknowledges receipt of, or access to, Carrier of Record's
      published tariff prior to booking, which governs all rates, rules, and practices. The tariff
      is incorporated by reference into this Agreement and is available on request.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        2.3 <em>Payment Terms.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Carrier of Record requires payment in full no later than one (1) business day prior to the
      scheduled loading date. If payment has not been received, Carrier of Record is not obligated
      to dispatch equipment or personnel. However, if Carrier tenders delivery without prior
      payment, Carrier's right to demand payment at delivery is limited by federal law to 100% of
      the binding estimate (for binding estimates) or 110% of the estimate (for non-binding
      estimates, if applicable), plus impracticable-operations charges up to 15% of all other
      charges due at delivery; any remaining lawful charges will be invoiced after delivery.
      Carrier of Record will not withhold delivery of a shipment once the Customer has paid the
      maximum amount due at delivery under federal law, as described above.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Accepted payment methods include major credit/debit cards, ACH, certified check, or money
      order, except where prohibited by applicable law, and in accordance with Carrier of Record's
      published tariff.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        2.4 <em>Deposits and Cancellations.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      At the time of booking, the shipper shall remit a deposit equal to ten percent (10%) of the
      total estimated charges as set forth in the written estimate. No shipment shall be scheduled
      without the required deposit. This cancellation policy is in addition to, and not in place
      of, the Customer's federal rescission rights under 49 CFR § 375.505(h).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Deposits are deemed earned upon booking and shall be non-refundable in the event the shipper
      cancels, reschedules, fails to tender shipment, or otherwise prevents performance on the
      scheduled pickup date. The deposit constitutes liquidated damages for reasonable
      administrative and reserved-capacity cost as permitted by 49 CFR § 375.401
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      If the shipper executes a Bill of Lading ("BOL") more than three (3) business days prior to
      the scheduled pickup date, the shipper may rescind such agreement within three (3) business
      days without penalty, in which case any deposit collected shall be refunded in full. If the
      BOL is signed on the scheduled pickup date or within three (3) business days thereof, no
      federal rescission right applies, and the deposit shall remain non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      After this 3-day rescission period expires, or if the BOL is signed within three (3)
      business days of the scheduled loading date, the following cancellation policy applies:{' '}
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        For cancellations made more than seventy-two (72) hours before the first scheduled service
        date (e.g., packing services) and more than seven (7) days before the move date, any
        deposit paid is non-refundable but may be applied as a credit toward a future move within
        twelve (12) months.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        Cancellations within seventy-two (72) hours of the first scheduled service date or within
        seven (7) days of the move date, whichever occurs first, may result in a cancellation fee
        not to exceed the lesser of: (a) actual costs incurred by Carrier of Record in preparation
        for the move; or (b) fifty percent (50%) of the estimated move cost.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        Cancellations within twenty-four (24) hours of the move date are non-refundable for the
        full move cost. Carrier of Record shall provide an itemized statement of costs upon
        request, and will retain supporting documentation for thirty-six (36) months.

        2.5 <em>Reasonable Dispatch and Delay Notices</em>.
      </strong>{' '}
      Carrier of Record performs transportation with reasonable dispatch. If Carrier of Record
      cannot meet the pickup or delivery dates or time windows shown on the Bill of Lading,
      Carrier of Record will promptly notify Customer and provide revised information. Pickup or
      delivery dates are not guaranteed unless expressly agreed in writing as a "guaranteed
      service" subject to applicable tariff provisions.

    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>3. VALUATION AND LIABILITY</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        3.1 <em>Disclosure of Options.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Federal law (49 CFR § 375.301(b) and § 375.505(b)(9)) requires that Customers be offered two
      levels of motor carrier liability: (a) Released Value Protection, set by federal regulation
      at $0.60 per pound per article, and (b) Full Value Protection, under which the Carrier of
      Record is liable for the replacement value of lost or damaged items (subject to exclusions).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.2 <em>Default Coverage - Full Value Protection</em>.
      </strong>{' '}
      Full Value Protection will apply by default to all shipments booked with Carrier of Record
      unless the Customer expressly elects Released Value Protection.{' '}
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.3 <em>Election of Valuation Coverage.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Customer's election between Full Value Protection and Released Value Protection will be made
      on the Bill of Lading at the time of service. The Bill of Lading will contain a valuation
      section requiring the Customer's signature. If the Customer does not sign to select Released
      Value Protection, Full Value Protection shall apply.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.4 <em>Full Value Protection Provided at No Additional Cost.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Carrier of Record provides Full Value Protection at no additional charge to the Customer.
      Under this coverage, Carrier will, at its option, (a) repair the item to restore it to its
      original condition, (b) replace the item with an item of like kind and quality, or (c) pay a
      cash settlement equal to the replacement value. Unless a higher lump-sum value is declared
      in writing on the Bill of Lading, Carrier's maximum liability for the shipment is the
      greater of $6.00 per pound of the entire shipment or $6,000 total, but not more than
      $100,000 unless a higher lump-sum value is declared on the Bill of Lading. Customers may
      declare a higher lump-sum value on the Bill of Lading; if so, Carrier's liability will be
      increased to that amount, subject to applicable tariff provisions. Valuation is not
      insurance; it is the motor carrier's contractual level of liability under federal law.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.5 <em>Released Value Protection (Optional Waiver).</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Customers who wish to waive Full Value Protection may elect Released Value Protection on the
      Bill of Lading. In that event, Carrier of Record's liability is limited to $0.60 per pound
      per article, regardless of the item's actual value.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.6 <em>High-Value / Extraordinary-Value Items.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Articles exceeding $100 per pound per article must be specifically identified by the
      Customer on the Bill of Lading (in the High-Value Declaration section or on a written
      inventory attached to the Bill of Lading) and accepted by Carrier of Record in writing at or
      before loading. If Customer fails to declare such items on the Bill of Lading or attached
      inventory, Carrier's liability for those items shall be limited to $0.60 per pound per
      article, even when Full Value Protection applies, as permitted by federal law and Surface
      Transportation Board released-rates orders.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        3.7 <em>Exclusions from Coverage</em>.
      </strong>{' '}
      Carrier of Record shall not be liable for loss or damage arising from the following causes,
      provided such exclusions are not inconsistent with applicable federal law and do not apply
      to loss or damage resulting from Carrier of Record's own negligence or that of its
      sub-haulers:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>inherent vice, defect, ordinary wear, or normal truck vibration;</li>
      <li>particleboard or ready-to-assemble furniture structural failures;</li>
      <li>electronics not in original or protective packaging;</li>
      <li>items expressly excluded in writing by Customer;</li>
      <li>
        items packed solely by Customer without disclosure of pre-existing damage where Carrier of
        Record had no opportunity to inspect;
      </li>
      <li>perishable, hazardous, contraband, or otherwise prohibited items;</li>
      <li>
        acts of God, mechanical failure, or events beyond Carrier of Record's reasonable control.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mb-4">
      {' '}
      All exclusions are subject to applicable valuation coverage and will not be applied in bad
      faith or without supporting documentation. Nothing in this section reduces or eliminates
      Carrier of Record's liability where inconsistent with 49 U.S.C. § 14706 (Carmack Amendment)
      or FMCSA regulations.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>4. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>
      <br />
      Customer shall: (a) provide accurate inventory and access details; (b) complete all packing
      (unless packing services are purchased); (c) be present at pickup and delivery; (d) ensure
      parking availability for the truck; (e) review and sign the written, itemized inventory at
      origin and destination if requested. Failure to sign does not waive your federal rights but
      may affect Carrier of Record's ability to verify loss or damage claims, except where such
      failure is attributable to Carrier of Record.{' '}
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>5. PROHIBITED ITEMS</strong>
      <br />
      Customer shall not transport: (a) Hazardous materials (e.g., fuel, bleach, propane,
      explosives); (b) perishable goods (e.g., fresh food); (c) contraband, illegal substances,
      firearms; (d) cash, precious metals, jewelry, sentimental items (e.g., family photo albums);
      (e) live plants or animals. Such items are excluded from liability and may result in
      immediate service termination.{' '}
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      These items are accepted only if declared in advance in writing and expressly agreed to by
      Carrier of Record; otherwise, Carrier shall not be liable for loss or damage to such items.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>6. DAMAGE CLAIMS</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        6.1 <em>Filing Deadline.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      All claims for loss or damage must be submitted in writing within nine (9) months from the
      date of delivery, or from the date delivery reasonably should have been made, in accordance
      with 49 CFR § 370.3(a). Nothing in this section waives or shortens any filing period
      expressly provided under federal law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        6.2 <em>Claim Submission.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      A written claim must (i) reasonably identify the shipment, (ii) assert Carrier liability,
      and (iii) demand a specified or determinable amount. Supporting photos or inventory numbers
      are encouraged but not required to perfect a claim. Carrier of Record will acknowledge the
      claim within 30 days, and within 120 days will pay, deny, or make a firm settlement offer.
      If additional time is needed, Carrier of Record will provide written status updates every 60
      days explaining the reason for the delay until final disposition. Any civil action to
      recover for loss or damage must be filed within two (2) years from the date Carrier provides
      written notice of disallowance of any part of a claim, consistent with 49 U.S.C. § 14706(e).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        7.1 <em>Claims First*</em>
      </strong>
      .* Before arbitration, you must first file a written claim with Carrier of Record or its
      designated claims service. Under federal law (49 CFR § 370.3), all claims for loss or damage
      must be filed within nine (9) months from the date of delivery (or from when delivery should
      reasonably have been made). Carrier of Record will acknowledge receipt of your claim within
      30 days and will pay, deny, or make a settlement offer within 120 days. If your dispute
      relates to charges billed after delivery, you must file within 180 days of the invoice date.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>
        7.2 <em>Right to Arbitration*</em>
      </strong>
      .* Carrier of Record maintains participation in an arbitration program, approved by the
      FMCSA in compliance with 49 U.S.C. § 14708, as a less expensive alternative to litigation.
      If your claim cannot be resolved through our claims process, you may request arbitration
      through Carrier of Record's arbitration program, administered by the Moving Authority
      Household Goods Arbitration Program in coordination with the National Arbitration and
      Mediation panel.

    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>
        7.3 <em>Scope of Arbitration.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      Arbitration may only address disputes involving: (i) loss or damage to your household goods;
      or (ii) whether additional charges billed by Carrier of Record must be paid.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Other types of claims (e.g., personal injury, lost wages, emotional distress, suspected
      fraud, or violations of law) are not subject to arbitration unless both you and Carrier of
      Record agree in writing.

          Protection or Full Value Protection). The arbitrator cannot award punitive damages,

      Digital acceptance of this Agreement is legally binding under ESIGN and UETA. By checking
      the box or clicking "I Agree" online, you agree to these Terms of Service. This digital
      acceptance has the same force as your handwritten signature. Valuation elections must be
      documented on the Bill of Lading at the time of service. Digital acceptance of these Terms
